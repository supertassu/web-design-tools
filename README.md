# Web Design Tools
A list of useful web design tools.
<hr>
This list is purely my preference; there might be better tools. (if so, let me know. thanks!)

## Editor of Choice

[Webstorm](https://jetbrains.com/webstorm/): Jetbrains's IDE for web. PhpStorm works too, I just prefer Webstorm for non-php-projects, idk why.

## Nice tools

- [Bytesize Icons](https://danklammer.com/bytesize-icons/): Nice icons. I've used FontAwesome and Feather before, but Bytesize has been easiest and simplest so far. 
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Web fonts (works elsewhere too)
  - Has great instructions and it supports almost all platforms. Really nice to use in my opinion.
- [UIKit](https://getuikit.com): Responsible UI Framework.
  - I used Bootstrap for a while, but decided to try UIKit for a project, and started to love it. 
- [ScrollReveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/): Easy scroll animations
  - I still prefel the old v2 style (v4 is coming...) Easy to use still, but v2 was easier.
- [w3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/): Validate your HTML.
  - Most browsers do not even alert if your HTML is not valid. I find this extremely bad practice.
- [Google](https://google.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): a soluction to all of your problems
  - Learn to use them. Period.
