# Web Design Tools
A list of useful web design tools
<hr>
This list is purely my preference; there might be better tools. (if so, let me know. thanks!)

## Nice tools

- [Feather](https://feathericons.com/): Web icons
  - I'm currently moving to feather from Font Awesome. Font Awesome works, but it is annoying to get a download (they email a link) and I find Feather icons to be nicer.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Web fonts (works elsewhere too)
  - Has great instructions and it supports almost all platforms. Really nice to use in my opinion.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/): Responsive web framework
  - Nothing much to say here. Really nice to use. #bs4hype
- [ScrollReveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/): Easy scroll animations
  - I still prefel the old v2 style (v4 is coming...) Easy to use still, but v2 was easier.
- [w3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/): Validate your HTML.
  - Most browsers do not even alert if your HTML is not valid. I find this extremely bad practice.
- [Google](https://google.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): a soluction to all of your problems
  - Learn to use them. Period.
